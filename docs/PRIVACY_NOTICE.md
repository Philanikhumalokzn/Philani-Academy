# Philani Academy Privacy Notice Update

_Last updated: 22 November 2025_

Philani Academy processes personal information in line with the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA). The learner enrolment experience now captures the following categories of data so that we can administer classes, satisfy regulatory requirements, and reach guardians in case of emergencies:

- **Identity details:** first name, last name, other names, South African ID number (optional) and date of birth.
- **Academic profile:** current grade placement and school or institution details.
- **Contact information:** primary email address, recovery email, primary mobile number and optional alternate mobile number.
- **Emergency contact information:** guardian/parent name, relationship to the learner and emergency mobile number.
- **Residential information:** street address, suburb, city/town, province, postal code and country.
- **Account preferences:** consent to POPIA-compliant processing and optional avatar image.

We use this information to:

1. Create and maintain learner accounts and enforce grade-based access controls.
2. Communicate with learners and guardians about lessons, billing and critical updates.
3. Reach guardians promptly during emergencies or pastoral care incidents.
4. Meet POPIA, basic education and payment processing obligations (including PayFast and institutional reporting).

Philani Academy stores all personal information securely in our managed database. Access is restricted to authorised administrative staff, and we retain the data only for as long as required to provide educational services and comply with legal obligations. Learners and guardians may request corrections, access or deletion by contacting support@philaniacademy.org.

By creating an account you acknowledge and consent to the processing of the above information. The profile settings page allows you to review and update these details at any time.
